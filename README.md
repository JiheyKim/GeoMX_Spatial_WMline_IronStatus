# Spatial Transcriptomics of Chronic-Active Lesions in Multiple Sclerosis

This project investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying chronic active white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS), with a focus on the role of iron-positive and iron-negative microglia/macrophages. MS is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system characterized by a transition from a relapsing-remitting phase to a progressive stage, where current therapies are largely ineffective.

Using spatial transcriptomics on postmortem MS brain tissue, we analyzed transcript profiles from iron-positive and iron-negative lesion rims, lesion cores, and surrounding normal white matter. Our approach revealed distinct transcriptional signatures associated with immune activation, IL-12 signaling, and cellular stress responses, depending on both the iron status and lesion region.

This repository contains data and analysis code supporting the reproducibility and spatial resolution of transcriptomic differences in MS lesions, aiming to provide insights into the localized inflammatory environments that drive lesion expansion and disease progression.
