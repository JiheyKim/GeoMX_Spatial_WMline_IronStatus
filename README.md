# Spatial Transcriptomics of Chronic-Active Lesions in Multiple Sclerosis

A tissue block containing two closely apposed cerebral WM lesions was excised from a cm-thick frozen hemispheric brain slice from a 65-year-old progressive MS patient with a 16-year disease duration and an EDSS score of 8.5. The block was sectioned in a cryostat at a thickness of 10 ums and characterized by staining for myelin (PLP antibodies) and microglia/macrophages (MHC Class II antibodies).Sections were also stained for iron using the Turnball method.

MHC Class II antibodies were tagged with xxx and applied to four adjacent 10 um-thick sections and collected in a GeoMX Digital Spatial Profiler. Collection and processing of MHC Class II-positive cells were performed as described in the GeoMX DSP Manual Slide Preparation User Manual. At least 5 ROIs (do we have an average area for ROIs) were drawn at the core and rim of both lesions and adjacent myelinated WM in the four sections (Fig 1).
